This was a submission for a regional full stack coding tournament.

Participants were given 3.5 hours to create a front end user interface
that accepts image uploads, sends them to a facial recognition API,
returns the results, and sends a report to the API if the user wants
to report the sighting to the police.

We were given the API endpoints and related parameters.

The submissions were graded on extensibility, presentation, functionality, and thoroughness


My submission utilized create-react-app, react, axios, css-grid, and flexbox


To run:

yarn install

yarn start
