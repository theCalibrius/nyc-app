This was my award-winning submission for the 2018 NYC Engineering Tournament.

A panel of judges reviewed my code and selected me as a Top Finisher.  I won a prize.

Participants were given 3.5 hours to create a front end user interface that:
1.  Allows user to upload images (of suspected criminals)
2.  Asyncronously sends submitted images to a facial recognition REST API
3.  Handles API response (% match and other relevant info) and display response data to the user
4.  In the event of a significant match, allows user to send an async notification (via Reporting REST API) to authorities
5.  Handles API response and informs user that their report was received

We were given the API endpoints and related parameters.

The submissions were graded on extensibility, presentation, functionality, and thoroughness

My submission utilized create-react-app, react, axios, css-grid, and flexbox and was designed to provide a smooth User Experience on any device.
